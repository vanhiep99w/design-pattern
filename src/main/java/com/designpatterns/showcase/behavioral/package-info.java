/**
 * Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the
 * assignment of responsibilities between objects.
 * 
 * Patterns to be implemented:
 * - Chain of Responsibility: Passes requests along a chain of handlers
 * - Command: Encapsulates requests as objects
 * - Iterator: Provides sequential access to elements
 * - Mediator: Reduces coupling between components
 * - Observer: Notifies multiple objects of state changes
 * - Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms
 * - Template Method: Defines algorithm skeleton in base class
 * - Visitor: Separates algorithms from objects
