/**
 * Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes
 * into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
 * 
 * Patterns to be implemented:
 * - Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
 * - Bridge: Separates abstraction from implementation
 * - Composite: Composes objects into tree structures
 * - Decorator: Adds new functionality to objects dynamically
 * - Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
 * - Proxy: Provides a surrogate for another object
